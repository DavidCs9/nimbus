Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. Use pnpm as the package manager.
2. Use alias `@/` to refer to the `src/` directory for all imports.
3. Use OOP principles and design patterns where applicable. For lib code, prefer classes and interfaces.
4. Use functional components and React hooks for UI code.
5. Focus UI design that fit in viewport vertically and horizontally without scrolling.
